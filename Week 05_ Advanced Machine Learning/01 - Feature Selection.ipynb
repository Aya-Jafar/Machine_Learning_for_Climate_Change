Some methods include:\n","\n","\n","- Removing features with low variance removes all features whose variance doesn’t meet some threshold. By default, it removes all zero-variance features, i.e. features that have the same value in all samples.\n","\n","- Using a correlation matrix to select features that are highly correlated with the output variable.\n","\n","- Using a statistical tests (e.g., $x^2$) to measure the statistical significance of each feature in relation to the label. \n","\n","- Using a recursive feature elimination algorithm to automatically select features that are most relevant to the output variable.\n","\n","- Select From Model is a meta-transformer that can be used alongside any estimator that assigns importance to each feature through a specific attribute (such as coef_, feature_importances_) after fitting. The features are considered unimportant and removed if the corresponding importance of the feature values are below the provided threshold parameter. Apart from specifying the threshold numerically, there are built-in heuristics for finding a threshold using a string argument.\n","\n","Why is  Feature Selection important?\n","\n","In the machine learning process, feature selection is used to make the process more accurate. It also increases the prediction power of the algorithms by selecting the most critical variables and eliminating the redundant and irrelevant ones. This is why feature selection is important.\n","\n","Three key benefits of feature selection are:\n","\n","- Decreases over-fitting  \n","\n","   Fewer redundant data means fewer chances of  making decisions based on noise.\n","\n","- Improves Accuracy  \n","\n","  Less misleading data means better modeling accuracy.\n","\n","- Reduces Training Time\n","\n","  Less data means quicker algorithms.\n","\n","There are many feature selection techniques supported by Scikit Learn. We will go through some of them and if you wish to learn more visit [Scikit Learn's
